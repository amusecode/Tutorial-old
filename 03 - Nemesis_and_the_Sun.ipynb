    "AMUSE is composed of domain-specific modules (i.e. the physics modules), which are often written in some native compiled language, and data-handling.\n",
    "The latter tends to be confusing for novel users.\n",
    "Data representation in AMUSE is often replicated.\n",
    "So can there be a parameter *mass* to indicate a property of a star in a stellar-evolution code, in a gravitational dynamics code and in your user script.\n",
    "These three parameters *mass* can mean the same, or they can have a different meaning.\n",
    "This makes running amuse somewhat confusing at times.\n",
    "Here we show how to formally separate these data streams.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Assignment 2: \n",
    "Add 100 zero-mass Oort cloud object in circular orbits around the Sun with semi-major axes equally spaced between 10000 au and 50000 au.\n",
    "Integrate those orbits for 10 full orbits of the Sun-Nemesis binary.\n",
    "Make a scatter plot of eccentricity as function of the semi-major axis for the initial and final Oort-cloud objects.\n",
    "Explain the figure.\n",

    "Be aware that 10 Nemesis periods is ~160 Myr, and running the system for that time will take a lot of time (about an hour).\n",
    "Start with shorter times and build up towards longer times when you know your code runs.\n",
    "You can also try different codes, and leaving out some planets.\n",
    "Is Mercury really that important? By leaving it out you may let the code take greater timesteps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3:\n",
    "Do you think that Nemesis could be the cause of periodic cometary visitors?"
