Of course, we only need to update the star's position and velocity in the potential and integrate those. So long as there are not other stars around, there is no need for a direct N-body code.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the N-body code offers us the opportunity to integrate a cluster of stars, rather than just a single star. In this way, we can study the evolution of a cluster in the Galactic potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have performed a small experiment in which a population of stars was evolved from zero-age to an age of 10Myr.\n",
    "The stars were selected randomly from a Salpeter mass function, and distributed in a virialized Plummer sphere with a characteristic (Plummer) radius of 1pc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignmnets and questions:\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 1:\n",
    "The output of the figure is not a nice smooth orbit, but a but jagged. Change the script in such a way that the orbit becomes more smooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2:\n",
    "The integration was for an (almost) ciruclar orbit. Sometimes, however, we are interested in more eccentric orbits.\n",
    "Integrate the orbit of the same star (at a starting distance of 8.5kpc from the Galactic center), but with a velocity in the *y*-direction of *22km/s*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1:\n",
    "If your star escaped the potentical of the Galaxy, why is that the case. What change do you have to make to the script to assure that the orbit is still correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2:\n",
    "Can you descript the orbit of the star in the eccentric orbit around the Galactic center?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2:\n",
    "Replace the single star for a cluster of 10 stars with masses from the Salpeter mass function (between 1MSun and 100Msun) in a Plummer sphere with a characteristic radius of 10pc. Run the simulation and plot the cluster center-of-mass while it orbits the Galactic center.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3: \n",
    "Describe what is different on this cluster center-of-mass orbit compared to the orbit of the single star.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4:\n",
    "Does the cluster stay bound?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3:\n",
    "Now change the orbital velocity of the cluster center-of-mass to 22km/s, as you did before in assignment 2, and redo the calculation.\n",
    "run the script again and describe how different the cluster orbit is not compared to the orbit of the single star.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 5:\n",
    "At what point in time does the cluster become unbound?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4:\n",
    "Redo the calculation of the cluster with 10 stars in an eccentric orbit around the Galactic center, but with a slightly different orbital velocity for each calculation, ranging from 22km/s, 44km/s, 66km/s, up to 440km/s.\n",
    "\n",
    "While doing the calculation the shortest distance of the cluster center to the Galactic center and measure the moment the cluster becomes unbound.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Plot the distance of closest approach as a function of the initial orbital velocity of the cluster.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Plot the moment the cluster dissolves as a function of its initial orbital velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make sure that you use the same cluster for each calculation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 6:\n",
    "At what speed does the cluster escape the Galaxy?\n",
    "And show with theoretical arguments that you could have expected this to happen at that particular speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 7:\n",
    "Explain the curve from plotting the cluster dissolution time as function of its orbital velocity in the Galactic potential."
